# Trade Progression of Greek Vases Seen through Find Spots
### Natalie DiMattia and Annabel Leisure

During the archaic period, the work of the “Achilles Painter” and the “Tyszkiewicz Painter” (580-560 BCE) was found primarily in spots on the Greek peninsula and other locations on the Aegean Sea. Twenty three vases were found on the mainland, while five were found in Asia Minor and Egypt. Only one find spot and one vase was located in Italy for archaic painters.

Comparatively, vases attributed to artists of the pioneer and classical periods are often found on the Italian peninsula. Vases of the pioneer group (520-500 BCE) were found in both Greece and Italy while vases of the classical period (mid-400s BCE) are found primarily in Italy.  The pioneer group vases appear to be the transition between the patterns seen in classical and archaic trade, with archaic trade focused on the Aegean and classical focused on the Italian peninsula, as the pioneer vases are found in spots in both Italy and Greece.

It is possible that the loss of trade to Asia Minor is due to the Persian conquest of Asia Minor in 546 BCE. Change of political power could have resulted in a shift in the trade patterns due to changing trade regulations. The expansion of trade into Italy during the pioneer era would have coincided with the founding of the Roman Republic in 509 BCE. As Rome was growing, pottery trade likely became more necessary and more lucrative.


The data presented is limited. Our data from the archaic and classical era was borrowed from another research group who may have had a different system for labeling their data points and could have made mistakes. This is evident in the find spot that apparently in the United Kingdom. Additionally, of the pioneer group data complied by our class, different working groups may have had different systems for encoding the data. The most likely source of error is in copying over the Pleiades number, as that is where my research group caught our own mistakes the most times. The pioneer data is also less than half of the data available in Beazley, as 75 of the 133 Beazely vases recorded did not have a listed find spot. It is possible that the find spots of those 75 vases could reveal entirely different patterns.
